# Scripts-for-Survey-Data-Analysis
Some Python scripts I created for the purpose of crosstabulating survey data using pandas and visualizing it using the seaborn library's heatmap function.

The files crossTab{01..03}.py crosstabulate their respective selected columns and display Heatmap_{01..03}.png. The file crossTab04.py produces a bivariate graph of a cross tabulation between peoples preferred work styles and the average score of their responses to positive questions regarding "remote work".

For the purposes of data analysis, we mainly asked interval questions and converted the interval scale to these numerical values:\
  1 - Strongly Disagree\
  2 - Disagree\
  3 - Neutral/Not Applicable\
  4 - Agree\
  5 - Strongly Agree\
